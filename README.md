# STAT 6685 Final Project

We are planning on using this dataset https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/birdclef-2022 for our final project.

We have some ideas of using the different information to inform an overall network, effectively creating an ensemble network. We may also just use the original sound classification.

A stretch goal that would be really fun after implementing these features would be to create a GAN to generate bird sounds. This I can look into, but I think we plan to just get a good performing network.

We can probably use this code https://www.kaggle.com/code/ivanpan/fork-of-fork-of-cls-exp-1-870246-021187-967146/notebook?scriptVersionId=96433080 from the kaggle submissions to pull the information for loading in the dataset, which would give a nice little bump to starting this project.
